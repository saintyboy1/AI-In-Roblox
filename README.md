# TEXT-SNT-001
I decided to make a free to use AI model for people looking to implement AI into their applications or Roblox games with a free to use endpoint you can use anywhere!
The model has around 1B parameters and can follow basic instructions and have a simple conversational.
OpenAI charges for API keys for usage of GPT-3/GPT-4 models so you can use this although simpler as an alternative for implementing AI capabilites into your projects.

The current endpoint of this is: https://api.s41nt.xyz You can interact via the web or send a GET request to the API. The most simple model which is currently in development is incredibly simple to access.
You need two parameters of which are: key and input. You can send a prompt via the web if you would like to try the model out for yourself too.

There is a maximum threshold of 50 requests a minute per IP address and is locked to one IP only to prevent abuse from the model.
This is the first version of the SNT series and we hope to release better models in the future.
